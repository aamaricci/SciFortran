***************************************************************************************************************

*The documentation is under construction*

Introduction
===============

SciFortran is a unitary collection of fortran modules and procedures for scientific calculations. The library aims to provide a simple and generic environment for any scientific or mathematic computations. The project is largely inspired by `SciPy` for `Python` and tries to closely follow its guidelines and naming convention. 

Although the library reached through years a rather advanced
development stage there are still many important areas which are still
not covered.
