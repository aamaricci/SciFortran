Build and Installation
#########################


SciFortran is available in the form of a static Fortran library
`libscifor.a` and the related Fortran module `SCIFOR`.
Our build system relies on CMake. Experimental support for linking
Intel's MKL is provided, although it may fail on some systems.



Building SciFortran
======================

Clone the repo:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   git clone https://github.com/SciFortran/SciFortran scifor

   
Optionally [1]_ define the fortran compiler:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   export FC=mpif90/gfortran/ifort


From the repository directory (`cd scifor`) make a standard
out-of-source CMake compilation:

GNU Make
------------
Using GNU `make` is the default CMake workflow, with widest version
support (CMake > 3.0). Note that parallel `make` execution is tested
and working.

.. code-block:: bash
		
   mkdir build 
   cd build  
   cmake .. 
   make -j



Ninja
------------
Using `ninja` if a fortran-capable [2]_ version of `ninja
<https://ninja-build.org>`_ is available in your system (and CMake can
[3]_ take advantage of it), you can use it to build the library at lightning, multi-threaded, speed. 

.. code-block:: bash
		
   mkdir build    
   cd build  
   cmake -GNinja ..  
   ninja

The `CMake` compilation can be customized using the following
additional variables (default values between `< >`):   

* `-DPREFIX = prefix directory <~/opt/scifor/VERSION/PLATFORM/[GIT_BRANCH]>` 

* `-DUSE_MPI = <yes>/no`  

* `-DVERBOSE = yes/<no>`  

* `-DBUILD_TYPE = <RELEASE>/TESTING/DEBUG/AGGRESSIVE`  

* `-DWITH_BLAS_LAPACK = yes/<no>`, to skip search of preinstalled linear algebra libraries and enforce compilation from source

* `-DWITH_SCALAPACK = <yes>/no`, to link with preinstalled ScaLAPACK library, for parallel algebra support.


Installation
======================
System-wide installation is completed after the build step using
either:

.. code-block:: bash

   make install

or

.. code-block:: bash
		
   ninja install

To actually link the library to any of your project we provide
different solutions:

* A generated `environment module <https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules>`_, installed to `~/.modules.d/scifor/<PLAT>/<VERSION>`  
* A generated `bash` script at `<PREFIX>/bin/configvars.sh`, to be sourced for permanent loading.
* A generated `pkg-config
  <https://github.com/freedesktop/pkg-config>`_ file to, installed to
  `~/.pkgconfig.d/scifor.pc`
  
which you can choose among by following the instructions printed on screen.

Uninstall
===================

Although CMake does not officially provide uninstall procedures in the
generated Make/Ninja files. Hence SciFortran supplies a homebrew
method to remove the generated files by calling (from the relevant
build folder):

.. code-block:: bash
		
   make uninstall

or

.. code-block:: bash
		
   ninja uninstall



Known issues
======================
`SciFortran` has been tested with success on several Unix/Linux
platforms. Support for Windows, through `WSL <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_, is still experimental, although few people reported successful installation with minimal efforts. 

Some have reported issues concerning the wrong setup for the library `pkg-config` file, contained in  `$PREFIX/<PLAT>/<VERSION>/etc/scifor.pc`. The variable `Libs=-L${libdir} -lscifor <blas/lapack/scalapack>` produced by `cmake` during the configuration and installation process can be not properly defined for the part corresponding to third parties libraries such as Blas/Lapack/Scalapack. This breaks compilation against `scifor` whenever `pkg-config` is used to generate the linking options. 

FIX: edit the `scifor.pc` file manually, overwriting the definition of the variable `Libs`, as appropriate for your system. 







.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [1] In some cases CMake fails to find the MPI fortran compiler,
       even if it is effectively installed and loaded into the
       system. An easy fix is to setup and export the `FC=mpif90`
       environment variable before invoking the `cmake <options> ..`
       command.
       

.. [2] Ninja did not support fortran before version 1.10, although
       Kitware has long mantained a fortran-capable fork, which might
       be obtained easily as a `Spack package
       <https://packages.spack.io/package.html?name=ninja-fortran>`_. Nevertheless
       we note that as of fall 2022 `pip install ninja --user` ships
       `Ninja v1.10.2 <https://pypi.org/project/ninja/>`_, hence
       obtaining a suitable official Ninja release should be trivial.
       

.. [3] This depends on your CMake version. Comparing `this
       <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/generator/Ninja.html#fortran-support>`_
       to this `one
       <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.17/generator/Ninja.html#fortran-support>`_
       would suggest that CMake started supporting Ninja's fortran
       features only after v3.17 but we have verified that at least
       v3.16.3 (current version shipped by `apt` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
       does indeed work. For more information you can take a look to
       the `related issue
       <https://github.com/QcmPlab/SciFortran/issues/16>`_.
